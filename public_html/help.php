    <h3>BEWARE OF SCAMMERS</h3><p> 
Scammers will unfortunately operate throughout Prntpage, along with every other website on the internet. Scammers take advantage of OVERSEAS boundaries which can give them protection to carry out their fraud.  
With Prntpage, we take a very active role in preventing their activities as much as possible. </p>
<h4>REPORT</h4> 
<p> Report any suspicious activity which could be evidence of a scam. The main issue that we have zero tolerance for is scamming and fraud. In order to prevent such activity, we need to be aware of it's existence. <br>
If someone messages you about paying for something, but wants to make the full payment including the deposit outside of the site, report the activity so we can evaluate if it's a scammer.<br>
If someone asks you to Western Union or money gram funds to them, report this as it is a scam.<br>
If someone wants you to wire bank funds, report this as it is a scam.<br>
DO NOT WESTERN UNION, MONEY GRAM OR SEND MONEY TO USERS FROM THE SITE<br>
Do not send money to someone by Western Union, Money Gram, or bank transfer to purchase a good or service, or pay for something off  of the website. <br>
All hotels, and BnBs should be purchased through the website. <br>
If you're buying a vehicle, plane, or boat, or any type of transportation, do not send a check, money order or cash to someone you have not met. Do not attempt to purchase transportation you have not seen in person and inspected.<br>
If you're contacted to give aid, charity, or financial assistance to a school, orphanage, church, mosque, shelter, or sanctuary, do not. There are registered, recognised charities which you should only donate to where you know the money will be used properly. </p>
